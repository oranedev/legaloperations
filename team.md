## Notes
- Emphasis on Docker and source deployment for backend-focused team members.
- PSTN setup requires backend and networking knowledge.
- Team members with ongoing learning (like Rafael and Luis in Node.js) are assigned supporting roles in those areas.
- Regular collaboration and knowledge sharing sessions are encouraged to foster team growth and skill development.
- A knowledge management platform to document the workflow will be needed, to onboard new team members and provide
  a practical learning experience
