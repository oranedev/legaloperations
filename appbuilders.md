# Glide vs. Retool - Choosing the Better Internal App Builder for a Legal Design Business

**Introduction:**

Glide and Retool are both no-code platforms that allow individuals to build apps without the need for extensive coding knowledge. However, there are key differences between the two that make each platform better suited for different purposes.

Glide is a no-code platform that enables non-technical users to build apps using data from Google Sheets, Excel, or Airtable. It provides beautifully designed templates and integrates well with popular spreadsheet applications. However, Glide has some drawbacks to consider. It has limitations in mobile app publishing, offering less flexibility in terms of app distribution. Additionally, it has limited login options and a restricted number of data sources.

On the other hand, Retool is a low-code platform aimed at developing company apps faster. It focuses on hosting apps on-premise and provides a drag-and-drop interface for building apps. Retool also offers connectivity to third-party tools through APIs, making it an ideal choice for developers and technical teams. However, it may not be as user-friendly for non-technical users compared to Glide.

When considering alternatives to Glide, some noteworthy options include Softr, Adalo, Bubble, and Webflow.

Softr is best suited for technical and non-technical small-to-medium-sized businesses (SMBs). It stands out with its user-friendly interface and a wide selection of ready-to-use templates.

Adalo is a great choice for mobile-focused teams as it allows users to create native apps for iOS and Android app stores.

Bubble caters to no-code generalists by providing numerous plugins and integrations. However, it may lack specific internal tool templates.

Webflow is an excellent option for designers and creatives due to its advanced responsive design capabilities and content management system (CMS).

Additionally, there are other tools worth mentioning in the context of Retool that offer similar functionalities or advantages compared to Retool according to reviewers. These include DronaHQ, Claris FileMaker, Appy Pie, AppMySite, Ninox, Process Street, OutSystems, and Airtable. Each of these platforms brings unique strengths and should be assessed based on individual requirements.

When choosing between Glide and Retool or exploring alternatives, it is crucial to consider specific needs and preferences. Factors such as the type of app being developed, level of customization required, integration capabilities, ease of use for non-technical users, and pricing should all be taken into account.
