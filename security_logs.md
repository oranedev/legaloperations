# Data Flow: Bubble ➡️ Azure Blob Storage ➡️ Elasticsearch
Data flow for tracking and visualizing security logs, from their creation in Bubble to their visualization in Kibana.

## 🛠 Data Creation in Bubble
- **User Interaction**: Users interact with your Bubble application, generating security logs. 🧑‍💻
- **Initial Storage**: These logs are initially stored in Bubble’s database. 💾

## 🚚 Transfer to Azure Blob Storage
- **Export Logs**: Security logs from Bubble are periodically exported to Azure Blob Storage as JSON files. 📦
- **Integration**: This can be done using server-side workflows in Bubble and Azure Blob Storage APIs. 🔗

## 🔄 Ingestion into Elasticsearch
- **Ingestion**: Elasticsearch, through its Azure Blob Storage integration, ingests these JSON files. 📥
- **Indexing**: It indexes the contents of the logs, making them searchable and analyzable. 🔍

## 📊 Visualization in Kibana
- **Dashboards**: Use Kibana to create dashboards that display the security logs. 📈
- **Metrics & Insights**: These dashboards can show various metrics and insights derived from the log data. 💡

## 🔐 Access and Security
- **Secured Chain**: Ensure that the entire chain is secured, with appropriate access controls at each stage. 🛡️
- **Authorized Access**: Only authorized personnel can access the logs and the visualizations. 👮‍♂️

#  Technology Stack for Enhanced Security

Breaking down the technology stack for enhancing the security posture of the data flow from Bubble to Azure Blob Storage and then to Elasticsearch:

## 1. Bubble Application <img src="https://branditechture.agency/brand-logos/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Bubble-1024x768.png" alt="Bubble Logo" width="160" height="100">
- **Role**: Frontend application and initial data handling.
- **Security Measures**:
  - Implement application-level security, such as input validation, authentication, and authorization.

## 2. Azure Blob Storage <img src="https://cloud-elements.com/wp-content/uploads/bfi_thumb/azureblob-01-15o4cbu594rs4v2qg4otqh3bce8zyek41pyetuwly0g7ac9c.png" alt="Blob Logo" width="160" height="100">
- **Role**: Storing large amounts of data securely and scalably.
- **Security Measures**:
  - **HTTPS for Data Transfer**: Ensure secure transfer using HTTPS.
  - **Azure Resource Manager Lock**: Protect against accidental or malicious deletion.
  - **SAS Tokens**: Use Shared Access Signatures with HTTPS-only access and limited permissions.
  - **RBAC**: Apply Role-Based Access Control for granular permission management.

## 3. AzCopy 
- **Role**: Optimal data transfer tool between Bubble and Azure Blob Storage.
- **Features**: Supports concurrency, parallelism, and resumable transfers.
- **Security Measures**: Utilize checksums to maintain data integrity.

## 4. Azure Data Factory 
- **Role**: Data integration and automated workflow service for regular data transfers.
- **Security Measures**: Secure data transfer pipelines and manage data transformations.

## 5. Elasticsearch 
- **Role**: Data indexing, search, and analysis.
- **Integration**: Direct ingestion from Azure Blob Storage.
- **Security Measures**: Secure the Elasticsearch cluster, control access, and manage data securely.

## 6. Kibana
- **Role**: Visualization and dashboard tool for Elasticsearch data.
- **Security Measures**: Implement access controls and secure connections.

## 7. Azure PowerShell/Azure CLI 
- **Role**: Scripting and automation of Azure services.
- **Use Case**: Automate Blob Storage management and data transfer tasks.

## 8. Azure Storage Explorer 
- **Role**: Graphical interface tool for managing Azure Storage accounts.
- **Use Case**: Manual management of blobs, useful for ad-hoc tasks.

## 9. Azure Security Tools 
- **Role**: Comprehensive security management.
- **Components**:
  - Azure Key Vault for secret management.
  - Azure Monitoring, and Azure Sentinel for security insights and threat detection.

## 10. Network Security 
- **Components**:
  - **Firewall Rules**: Limit access to Azure resources.
  - **Private Endpoints**: Secure traffic between Azure VNet and Blob Storage.
  - **VNet Service Tags**: Manage network access controls.

## 11. Additional Azure Features 
- **Access Tiers**: Manage storage costs by using different access tiers in Azure Blob Storage.
- **Data Integrity**: Use Azure Blob Storage features for data integrity, like immutable blobs for WORM (Write Once, Read Many) storage.
