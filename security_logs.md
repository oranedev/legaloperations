# Data Flow: Bubble ➡️ Azure Blob Storage ➡️ Elasticsearch
Data flow for tracking and visualizing security logs, from their creation in Bubble to their visualization in Kibana.

## 🛠 Data Creation in Bubble
- **User Interaction**: Users interact with your Bubble application, generating security logs. 🧑‍💻
- **Initial Storage**: These logs are initially stored in Bubble’s database. 💾

## 🚚 Transfer to Azure Blob Storage
- **Export Logs**: Security logs from Bubble are periodically exported to Azure Blob Storage as JSON files. 📦
- **Integration**: This can be done using server-side workflows in Bubble and Azure Blob Storage APIs. 🔗

## 🔄 Ingestion into Elasticsearch
- **Ingestion**: Elasticsearch, through its Azure Blob Storage integration, ingests these JSON files. 📥
- **Indexing**: It indexes the contents of the logs, making them searchable and analyzable. 🔍

## 📊 Visualization in Kibana
- **Dashboards**: Use Kibana to create dashboards that display the security logs. 📈
- **Metrics & Insights**: These dashboards can show various metrics and insights derived from the log data. 💡

## 🔐 Access and Security
- **Secured Chain**: Ensure that the entire chain is secured, with appropriate access controls at each stage. 🛡️
- **Authorized Access**: Only authorized personnel can access the logs and the visualizations. 👮‍♂️
