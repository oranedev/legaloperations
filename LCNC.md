# The Importance of No-Code Platforms in Legal Design and Team Workflow

In recent years, the emergence of no-code platforms has revolutionized the way legal experts approach application development. These platforms allow non-technical individuals to build self-service apps without any programming knowledge, enabling them to automate low-complexity and repetitive tasks within their legal teams. This report will discuss the relevance and implications of no-code platforms in legal design and team workflow.

## No-Code Platforms Overview

No-code platforms utilize building blocks and forms to design the logic behind an application. These platforms come equipped with pre-built features, databases, hosting capabilities, and integrations, making it easier for legal experts to create applications tailored to their specific needs. The use of no-code platforms empowers in-house legal teams to manage more work efficiently and cut costs by eliminating the need to rely on external developers or IT support.

## Advantages of No-Code Platforms

One significant advantage of using no-code platforms is the speed at which applications can be designed, built, and launched. Unlike traditional development processes that can take months or even years, no-code applications can be created in a matter of weeks. This rapid turnaround time allows legal experts to turn their knowledge into self-service applications quickly.

## Democratizing Access to Legal Information

Self-service applications built on no-code platforms make legal knowledge scalable, accessible, and available 24/7. Currently, only 16% of contracts are self-serviced according to a survey[^1]. By leveraging no-code platforms, legal experts can democratize access to legal information, empowering individuals to handle routine legal matters independently.

## Rise of LCNC Development

Moreover, the rise in popularity of low-code/no-code (LCNC) development alternatives has further enhanced the efficiency of business processes across various industries. LCNC platforms allow users from different departments, including legal teams, to quickly build applications and automate processes without requiring extensive coding skills[^2]. This increased collaboration between subject-area specialists and IT professionals improves overall workflow efficiency.

LCNC platforms are based on model-driven design principles, automatic code generation, and visual programming, making them accessible to users familiar with business processes regardless of coding experience. These platforms streamline complex processes and increase efficiency and agility for IT departments[^3]. With LCNC platforms being used in industries such as supply chain management, manufacturing, accounting and finance, human resources, and IT departments[^4], their versatility is apparent.

## Webflow: A Case Study

Webflow is one such no-code platform that allows businesses to build, launch, and update websites quickly without the need for additional developers[^5]. It offers full control over user experience design while staying on brand. By eliminating the need for developers and reducing infrastructure management costs, Webflow enables businesses to improve key performance indicators (KPIs) by shipping impactful campaigns and optimizing conversions[^6].

With over 3.5 million designers and teams using Webflow[^7], it has become a trusted platform known for faster time-to-launch compared to traditional web development processes[^8]. Collaboration features within Webflow facilitate better teamwork, faster project completion, and prevention of unauthorized changes[^9]. Additionally, fine-tuned controls and flexible content management tools help optimize search engine optimization (SEO) efforts and improve discoverability[^10].

## Future of LCNC Platforms

The adoption of LCNC platforms is growing rapidly across industries. Projections indicate that these platforms will be used in over 65% of application developments worldwide by 2024[^11]. The rise of LCNC development alternatives signifies a shift towards empowering individuals within organizations to contribute actively to app development processes while reducing reliance on specialized coding skills.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, no-code platforms have become essential tools for legal experts seeking to streamline their workflows through automation. By empowering non-tech professionals to build self-service apps without programming knowledge, these platforms enable legal teams to manage more work efficiently while cutting costs. Additionally, the rise in popularity of LCNC development alternatives offers opportunities for improved collaboration between subject-area specialists and IT professionals across various industries. The future looks promising for no-code and low-code app development as they continue to transform how legal firms approach innovation and automation within their organizations.
